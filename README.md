# Store-Sales-prediction
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and articular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

## Objective
Build a solution that should able to predict the sales of the different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset.
